# Student-Grade-Calculator.
This project is a functional web application developed to explore practical programming concepts. Although the BMKT 1723 course focuses on C++ console programming, this application translates those fundamental concepts into a web-based environment. It helps students input course marks, calculate averages, and determine final grades.
